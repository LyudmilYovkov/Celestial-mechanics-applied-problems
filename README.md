# Celestial-mechanics-applied-problems

The celestial coordinates and the coordinates of the speed of the planets 
have been caluclated for a specific calendar date based on Kepler's formulae.
The numerical results have been summarized in a table.

Delaunay and Poincare elements (of first and second type) for every planet
have been calculated based on known physical constants and astronomy laws.
